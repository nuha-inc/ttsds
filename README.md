As many recent Text-to-Speech (TTS) models have shown, synthetic audio can be close to real human speech. However, traditional evaluation methods for TTS systems need an update to keep pace with these new developments. Our TTSDS benchmark assesses the quality of synthetic speech by considering factors like prosody, speaker identity, and intelligibility. By comparing these factors with both real speech and noise datasets, we can better understand how close synthetic speech is to human speech.

This fork adds file-level score tracking to TTSDS, enabling per-file analysis of benchmark results. The only modification to the original codebase is the addition of file-level score collection in the `BenchmarkSuite` class. The actual anomaly detection and analysis is implemented in our separate evaluation tool.

Key changes:
- Added `file_results` dictionary to store per-file benchmark scores
- Modified `_run_benchmark` to collect individual file results
- Preserved all original TTSDS functionality

For the current benchmark results, see https://huggingface.co/spaces/ttsds/benchmark.

## Installation

### Pip

```console
pip install ttsds
```

## Getting Started

To get started with using TTSDS for your own data, see [examples/getting_started](https://github.com/ttsds/ttsds/tree/main/examples/getting_started).

## Miscellaneous

### Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- System packages: ``ffmpeg automake autoconf unzip sox gfortran subversion libtool``
- On some systems, the fairseq installation may fail due to conflicting dependencies. In this case, you can install this fork of fairseq https://github.com/MiniXC/fairseq-noconf

### Caching

Please set ``TTSDS_CACHE_DIR`` environment variable to a directory where you want to cache the downloaded models and data.
